## Resources

* [https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169](Visually Hidden) - I used the CSS from this project to hide my headings for screen readers.

## Comments

* I kept getting errors from Stylelint "Unable to run stylelint" because three lines 43, 44, and 46 were "undefined rules". I took them out temporarily so I could run Stylelint while I coded, but added them back at the end and got the same errors.
